(Preamble)
G90 G64 P0.1 Q1

(Switch to Joint mode trivial kinematics)
("M429" sets offsets to "G59.2" and resets those)
(to "G10 L2 P8 X0 Y-90 Z0 A0 B0 C180" so we match the DH-)
(Parameter model used in the kinematics to include theta)

M429

(Set the start pose to make sure the kinematics can handle it)

G01 X0 Y0 Z0 A0 B10 C0 F1000

(Switch to Coordinated, i.e. cartesian, world mode)
("M428" sets offsets to "G59.1" and resets those)
(to "G10 L2 P7 X0 Y0 Z0 A0 B0 C0")
(Origin is at bottom center of the robot base)
